# TypeScript Practice

So I have started this project to practice Typescript. This is my first project in TS.

## Update

* The stetes are all inside  the "<App/>" component.
* <Board/> && <Controls/> will get access to them from the "game" object which is passed to them as props.
* <Board> is done now work on <Controls/>
