# TypeScript Practice

So I have started this project to practice Typescript. This is my first project in TS.

## Topics I learned

* How to use TS classes.
* The type of setState functions.
* How to implement a simple bot.
* What is a MinMax Bot?
* How to implement it?
* AND LOTS OF FRUSTATION DUE TO MOVING STATE CONSTANLTY.
  
Like seriously I moved the entire state of the application atleast 20 times because I can't implement a feature cuz the class or component doesnt have access to the Board and Player states.

I was this close to just using the Redux Toolkit.
Which would have been overkill for this project. Still think React is Overkill.

And Damn thought the project would take just a Day. Because I already built it once in just plain HTML, CSS, JS. That one has even a gif when winner is selected.

Ok that one doesn't have a bot at all but still.

IT TOOK 3 DAYS FOR THIS!!!
